# Video Player Test Specifications

## Overview
This document defines comprehensive test specifications for the video player component. These specifications should be used to guide development following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. All tests should be written and failing before implementation begins.

## Test Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Minimum 85% for all business logic
- **Integration Test Coverage**: Critical user paths must have 100% coverage
- **E2E Test Coverage**: Core workflows must be tested across all supported platforms
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Must meet or exceed defined thresholds

## 1. Core Playback Tests

### 1.1 Video Initialization Tests
```gherkin
Feature: Video Player Initialization
  As a user
  I want the video player to initialize correctly
  So that I can watch video content without issues

  Background:
    Given a valid video source URL
    And supported browser environment

  Scenario: Successful Player Initialization
    When the player component mounts
    Then the player should create a video element
    And initialize Video.js instance
    And emit "ready" event within 2 seconds
    And display loading state until metadata loads

  Scenario: Metadata Preload
    Given a video URL with valid metadata
    When the player initializes with preload="metadata"
    Then the player should fetch video metadata
    And display video duration in controls
    And show video title if available
    And display first frame as poster
    And emit "loadedmetadata" event

  Scenario: Auto-play Behavior
    Given browser autoplay policy allows it
    When player initializes with autoplay="true"
    Then video should start playing automatically
    And muted attribute should be set if required by browser
    And emit "play" event
    But should not autoplay if user preference is disabled

  Scenario: Player Initialization Failure
    Given an invalid or unreachable video source
    When the player attempts to initialize
    Then show user-friendly error message
    And emit "error" event with error details
    And provide retry mechanism
    And log error to analytics
```

### 1.2 Playback Control Tests
```gherkin
Feature: Video Playback Controls
  As a user
  I want to control video playback
  So that I can watch content at my own pace

  Scenario: Play/Pause Toggle via UI
    Given a loaded video in paused state
    When user clicks the play button
    Then video should start playing
    And play button should change to pause icon
    And emit "play" event
    And progress bar should start advancing
    When user clicks the pause button
    Then video should pause
    And pause button should change to play icon
    And emit "pause" event
    And progress bar should stop advancing

  Scenario: Seeking via Progress Bar
    Given a video with duration of 60 seconds
    When user clicks at 50% of progress bar
    Then video should seek to 30 seconds
    And emit "seeking" event
    And show loading indicator if buffering
    And emit "seeked" event when complete
    And update current time display

  Scenario: Volume Control
    Given video is playing with volume at 50%
    When user drags volume slider to 75%
    Then video volume should update to 0.75
    And emit "volumechange" event
    And save volume preference to localStorage
    When user clicks mute button
    Then video should mute
    And show muted icon
    And remember previous volume level

  Scenario: Playback Rate Control
    Given video is playing at normal speed
    When user selects 2x playback rate
    Then video should play at double speed
    And emit "ratechange" event
    And maintain pitch correction
    And save rate preference
```

### 1.3 Buffering and Network Tests
```gherkin
Feature: Buffering and Network Handling
  As a user
  I want smooth playback even with network issues
  So that I can watch without interruptions

  Scenario: Initial Buffering
    Given a video starting to load
    When playback is initiated
    Then show buffering spinner
    And preload minimum buffer (5 seconds)
    And start playback when buffer threshold met
    And hide spinner when playing

  Scenario: Mid-playback Buffering
    Given video is playing normally
    When playback position catches up to buffer
    Then pause playback automatically
    And show buffering indicator
    And emit "waiting" event
    And resume when 3 seconds buffered ahead
    And emit "playing" event

  Scenario: Adaptive Bitrate Switching
    Given multiple quality levels available
    When network bandwidth changes
    Then player should measure bandwidth
    And switch to appropriate quality
    And maintain playback position
    And emit "qualitychange" event
    And show quality indicator briefly

  Scenario: Network Error Recovery
    Given video is playing
    When network connection is lost
    Then detect error within 3 seconds
    And show "Connection Lost" message
    And attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
    And resume from last position on recovery
    And emit appropriate error events

## 8. Accessibility Tests

### 8.1 Screen Reader Support
```gherkin
Feature: Screen Reader Accessibility
  As a visually impaired user
  I want full screen reader support
  So that I can navigate and control the player

  Scenario: ARIA Labels and Roles
    Given a screen reader is active
    When player loads
    Then all controls have appropriate ARIA labels
    And video region has role="application"
    And controls have correct roles (button, slider, etc.)
    And live regions announce state changes

  Scenario: Keyboard Navigation with Screen Reader
    When user tabs through controls
    Then screen reader announces each control
    And announces current value for sliders
    And provides usage instructions
    And announces playback state changes
```

### 8.2 Captions and Subtitles
```gherkin
Feature: Caption Support
  As a user who needs captions
  I want reliable caption display
  So that I can understand the content

  Scenario: Caption Display
    Given video has caption tracks
    When user enables captions
    Then captions display clearly
    And maintain readability over video
    And sync properly with audio
    And handle multiple speakers

  Scenario: Caption Customization
    When user opens caption settings
    Then allow font size adjustment
    And allow color customization
    And allow background opacity
    And save preferences
```

  As a user
  I want a seamless viewing experience
  From start to finish

  Scenario: Full Video Watching Flow
    Given user navigates to video page
    When page loads
    Then show video thumbnail and title
    When user clicks play button
    Then video starts playing smoothly
    When user adjusts volume to comfortable level
    Then volume persists for future videos
    When user enables subtitles
    Then subtitles appear synchronized
    When user enters fullscreen
    Then video fills entire screen
    When video completes
    Then show related videos or replay option
    And track completion analytics
```

## Test Execution Strategy

### Priority Levels
1. **P0 - Critical**: Player initialization, basic playback, error handling
2. **P1 - High**: Controls, seeking, keyboard navigation, mobile support
3. **P2 - Medium**: Advanced features, analytics, performance optimization
4. **P3 - Low**: Edge cases, rare browsers, experimental features

### Test Environments
- **Development**: Unit tests run on every commit
- **Staging**: Integration tests run on PR
- **Production**: E2E tests run before deployment
- **Monitoring**: Synthetic tests run every 15 minutes

### Continuous Integration Pipeline
```yaml
test-pipeline:
  - unit-tests:
      coverage: 85%
      timeout: 5m
  - integration-tests:
      browsers: [chrome, firefox, safari]
      timeout: 15m
  - e2e-tests:
      scenarios: critical-paths
      timeout: 30m
  - performance-tests:
      lighthouse: true
      load-testing: true
      timeout: 20m
  - accessibility-tests:
      axe-core: true
      screen-readers: [NVDA, JAWS]
      timeout: 10m

## Notes for Implementation

1. **Write Tests First**: Following TDD, all tests should be written before implementation
2. **Test Independence**: Each test must be able to run in isolation
3. **Deterministic Results**: Tests should not be flaky or dependent on timing
4. **Clear Failure Messages**: When tests fail, the reason should be immediately clear
5. **Performance Budget**: Tests themselves should complete within defined timeouts
6. **Documentation**: Each test should clearly document what it's testing and why
7. **Maintenance**: Tests should be refactored alongside code changes
8. **Coverage Gaps**: Regular audits should identify untested code paths

This specification serves as the contract between test and implementation. Any behavior not specified here should be discussed and added before implementation.
