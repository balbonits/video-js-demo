# User Vision Document

## My Vision for the Video Player

Based on the user's notes, document their vision of a **modular, hierarchical player framework** with:

### Core Architecture Concept
- Central/core player instance
- Platform-specific implementations build on top
- Pluggable libraries for different concerns

### Platform Hierarchy
```
Player
├── Web
│   ├── Chromecast Player
│   ├── WebView Player
│   ├── React Player
│   └── Embed Player
├── OTT
│   ├── Tizen
│   ├── Roku
│   └── WebOS
└── Native
    ├── iOS
    └── Android
```

### Pluggable Framework Vision
```
Player
├── player-analytics
├── player-metrics
├── player-controls
└── player-drm
```

## Key Requirements
1. **Team Parallelization** - Different teams can work on different modules
2. **Reduced Blockades** - Avoid bugs/features blocking other development
3. **Protocol Support** - HLS, DASH, MPEG + others
4. **DRM Support** - Widevine, PlayReady + others

## Technical Preferences
- Modular architecture
- Plugin-based system
- Framework approach for scalability
- Support for parallel development

## Questions & Research Needed
- Complete list of platforms to support
- Additional protocols beyond HLS/DASH/MPEG
- DRM options beyond Widevine/PlayReady
- Framework approaches for player modularity

## Implementation Strategy

### Modular Development Approach
The architecture should enable independent development of each component:

#### Core Player Module
- Base playback engine
- Common API surface
- Event system
- Plugin registration system

#### Platform Abstraction Layer
Each platform implementation inherits from the core player but provides platform-specific optimizations:

**Web Platform**
- Browser-specific optimizations
- DOM manipulation
- CSS styling system
- Input device handling

**OTT Platform**
- TV remote navigation
- 10-foot UI considerations
- Performance optimizations for limited hardware
- Platform-specific APIs (Tizen, Roku, WebOS)

**Native Platform**
- Native UI components
- Hardware acceleration
- Platform media frameworks
- Device-specific capabilities

#### Plugin System Architecture
Standardized plugin interface allows for:
- **Analytics Plugins**: Different providers (Google Analytics, Adobe, custom)
- **Metrics Plugins**: Performance monitoring, QoS tracking
- **Controls Plugins**: Custom UI components, themes
- **DRM Plugins**: Multiple content protection systems

### Development Benefits
1. **Parallel Development**: Teams can work on analytics while others work on controls
2. **Reduced Dependencies**: Bug in analytics doesn't block control development
3. **Flexible Deployment**: Mix and match plugins based on needs
4. **Easier Testing**: Each module can be tested independently
5. **Scalable Teams**: New teams can own specific plugins/platforms

## Success Criteria

### Architecture Goals
- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns between components
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new platforms or plugins
- **Performance**: No significant overhead from abstraction layers
- **Maintainability**: Each module can be updated independently
- **Developer Experience**: Simple APIs for plugin and platform development

### Technical Milestones
- [ ] Core player API definition complete
- [ ] Plugin registration system functional
- [ ] At least 2 platform implementations working
- [ ] At least 3 plugin types implemented
- [ ] Parallel team development demonstrated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met across platforms
