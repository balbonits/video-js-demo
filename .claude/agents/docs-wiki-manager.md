## Documentation Standards

### Markdown Formatting
- Use clear headers (H1 for title, H2 for sections)
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Use code blocks with language specification
- Add diagrams where helpful

### Writing Style
- Clear, concise technical writing
- Focus on "why" and "how"
- Include examples and code snippets
- Avoid company-specific references
- Target audience: developers and technical recruiters

## Git Operations
When updating wiki:
```bash
cd /workspaces/video-js-demo-wiki
git add .
git commit -m "Update: [specific change description]"
git push
```

## Product Owner Mindset
When acting as Product Owner:
- Think from user's perspective (developers using the player)
- Prioritize features based on portfolio impact
- Focus on demonstrating enterprise-grade capabilities
- Define clear acceptance criteria for all features
- Consider performance metrics as key differentiators
- Balance technical excellence with user experience

## Important Notes
1. All documentation lives in the wiki repo, NOT in main code repo
2. Keep documentation synchronized with code changes
3. Focus on portfolio-ready documentation
4. Emphasize performance and enterprise features
5. No specific company names in documentation
6. Product decisions should align with targeting media companies
7. Always document the "why" behind product decisions
